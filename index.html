           My name is Michael A. Myers, and I am a web developer in training, but before I set out on the
            journey to become a programmer, allow me to tell you a story of how it all started. A long time ago,
            in a galaxy far far away...opps, wrong story. That was my other life when I was a nefarious space slug.
            I still haven't forgave Solo for stepping on me, anyways where are my manners.
            Let's continue with the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Highschool, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so
            I did what every young adult does, "party". It wasn't until, I turned 19 that my dad said, "I needed to do
            something with my life". I replied by saying, "Don't tell me how to live my life", but shortly after I packed
            up my things and headed to Fort Jackson, South Carolina for The United States Army's Basic Training Program.
            This story gets really boring, so lets fast forward.

            8 years later, after being deployed 3 times to Iraq, I decided to retire. I just couldn't risk another deployment.
            I came back to Los Angeles to be reunited with my family. I took advantage of the services provided to Veterans
            and I used my GI Bill to attend an art school. I have always been good at art, so I said why in the hell not? Lets
            fast forward 4 years later. I graduated with a B.S in Media Arts and was awarded, "Best Portfolio". 2 weeks later I
            landed my first job as a graphic designer making 15 dollars an hour. I know what you're thinking all that for
            15 dollars? Well, you have to start somewhere. 3 years later I'm curently the lead graphic designer at Pridesash.
            The company put me on Salary and sent me to Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension for a web developer postion.
